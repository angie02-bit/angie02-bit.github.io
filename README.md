<p>Creative statement</p>
    <p>As I get older, I hope my filmmaking journey continues to grow, and I’m able to give my grandma a source of expression. What originally began with an obsession with photography, editing my favorite shows while self-teaching myself Adobe After Effects. Has now developed a love for storytelling and the process of manipulating all elements (lighting, effects, location). Knowing each project is personal, and viewers will either witness a new perspective in life, or they will relate and feel like, for once, someone out there can relate to their same emotions, way of thinking, anxieties, struggles, etc.

I remember my grandma telling me her life as a kid in a developing country. I asked her if she had ever had a paranormal experience there. The story she described to me has stuck with me for years now, and I am itching to make it into a film. Whether it's a 3-minute short film or an hour and a half feature film. All I know is a story that the original must be made into a visual for others to witness. Although it’s not just about the story, what inspires my creativity most is the culture my stories come from. Peruvian culture is extremely beautiful. I describe it as almost mind and soul healing. Peru is making its way up in the main media, and I would like to help give the country an extra push in the spotlight, so others can experience the love and healing of the Peruvian experience.<p>
