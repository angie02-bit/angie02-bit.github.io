<h1>"In Plato's Cave" On Photography</h1>
<p>I use photography as a way to preserve and deepen human connections. I have so many blurry memories as a child that I wish I could've captured to be able to really see a clear picture. Like Susan Sontag mentioned, “People robbed of their past seem to make the most fervent picture takers, at home and abroad.” With the minimal photos I do have, I cherish them more and more as time goes by and the images start aging. For example, I have a memory of my father and me dancing, and he’s throwing me in the air; it is one of my favorite childhood memories ever. I unfortunately don't have any images of that time of my life, but I do have a photo of him and me dancing a couple of years later.
    If I hadn’t seen that image, I probably would've forgotten those special moments, and considering I hadn't seen him in years, the memories I had in my head and minimal physical pictures were the only things I had left to hold on to. I refused to forget those moments and the culture I grew up in. Those photographs influenced me a lot growing up. It would trigger memories of songs I would hear at family parties, cultural dances, and foods. Doing research and rediscovering so much of my childhood I had completely forgotten about helped me keep and preserve my connections with family members despite our distances. Many people from older generations did not have the privilege of smartphones, who wish they had more images from their younger lives. “Photographs actively promote nostalgia.” Instead, they only have a glimpse of images in their head for them to daydream about.
