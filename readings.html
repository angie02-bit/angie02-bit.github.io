    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>I use photography as a way to preserve and deepen human connections. I have so many blurry memories as a child that I wish i couldve captured to be able to really see a clear picture. Like Susan Sontag mentioned, “People robbed of their past seem to make the most fervent picture takers, at home and abrod” With the minimal photos I do have I cherish them more and more as time goes by and the images start aging. For example, I have a memory of my father and I dancing and he’s throwing me in the air, it is one of my favorite childhood memories ever. I unfortunately dont have any images of that time of my life, but I do have a photo of him and I dancing a couple years later. If i hadn’t seen that image I probably wouldve forgotten those special moments, and considering I hadnt seen him in years, the memories i had in my head and minimal physical pictures were the only things i had left to hold on to so i wouldn’t forget those moments and the culture I grew up in. Those photographs influenced me a lot growing up. It would trigger memories of songs I would hear at family parties, cultural dances and foods. Doing research and rediscovering so much of my childhood I had completely forgotten about helped me keep and preserve my connections with family members despite our distances. There are many people from older generations who did not have the privilege of smartphones who wish they had more images from their younger lives, “photographs actively promote nostalgia.” Instead they only have a glimpse of images in their head for them to daydream about.

It's unfortunate that our world today has gotten so obsessed with proving their attendance to certain eventst. To visually capture this I would capture moments when there are groups of people all with their heads down to their phone, especially if they are recording during a dangerous situation. “Needing to have reality confirmed and experience enhanced by photographs is an aestheic consumerism to which everyone is now addicted.” Emphasizing how neglectful we as a society are towards each other in real life because of the addiction to be so connected and active online. This is what results in a desentisized society and inappropriate reactions especially from younger generations . To show that photography or image capturing isn’t what’s stopping people from living in the moment. It’s the device, because a smart phone gives a person the ability to immediately access the image to be analyzed, edited and shared. A multi-app device is what traps people for so long. Whereas, if you see photos of people from something like a disposable camera where access to the image isnt immediate due to the development process of the images. Photographs seem to capture more genuine moments, living in the most sincere energy. Because one isnt worried if the image looks perfect. The inability to access the image immediately allows people to still enjoy the moment undisturbed. Out of sight out of mind mentality.
