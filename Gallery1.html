    I chose this image because it looked very aesthetically pleasing, with the symmetry of the hallway caused by the reflection of the wall. I went ahead and played with the levels on the adjustment layer to deepen the colors and shadows in the space. Creating a more gloomy environment, Im assuming that the person in this image is on their way home, finishing their day. As the rest of the crowd on their left is still waiting for their turn to go home too.
